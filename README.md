## üìñ Introduction

PixelShift is a powerful, open-source browser extension crafted for developers who want to build websites that look and work flawlessly across all screen sizes without constantly switching devices or browser windows.

In today's world of responsive web design, testing your website on just one screen isn‚Äôt enough. That‚Äôs where PixelShift steps in.

- Debug efficiently using the integrated dev console per screen
- Save time switching between screen resolutions manually

PixelShift aims to streamline your front-end workflow whether you're building mobile-first UIs, fixing bugs in a responsive layout, or just want to see how your site looks on a Galaxy Fold and a MacBook side-by-side.
